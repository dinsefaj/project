    <p><h3>Afia e-Pharmacy business aimed to provide healthcare services to Ethiopian people<br>
      in short time program initiative and to extend the plan to Africa in  near future <br>
We aimed to provide various medicines to various patients who have chronic diseases to promote <br>
 healthcare resources shortly. Besides that we are expected to provide healthcare access for all. <br>
Hence, the need to develop healthcare infrastructure for all levels of care deliveryâ€”primary, <br>
secondary, and tertiary- has to be re-emphasised.The  e-Pharmacy will holds the stock of <br>
medicines/drugs stored in warehouses/fulfilment centres <br>across geographic locations. <br>
Once the e-Pharmacy receives orders on its website/app, they are checked by the registered <br>
pharmacists.Orders that require a prescription fit a valid e-prescription / scanned prescription <br  >
 by the consumer on the website. Medicines/drugs are not dispensed without a valid prescription. <br>
Registered pharmacists wrap the medicines in a tamperproof pack and deliver them to customers <br>
through a courier service
